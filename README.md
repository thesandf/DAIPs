# üõ†Ô∏è Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property (DAIP) Platform .


### The Decentralized Autonomous Intellectual Property (DAIP) Platform is a decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to create, manage, buy, sell, and govern digital assets representing intellectual properties. These DAIPs combine the features of NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens) and DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations), providing a new model for managing intellectual property with community-driven governance.

### This project integrates smart contracts on Ethereum (or other EVM-compatible networks), NFT standards, and DAO governance mechanisms to bring full decentralization and transparency to intellectual property rights management.

## Features
## _üåü Core Features_
- Create DAIPs: Users can mint unique DAIP tokens that represent intellectual property such as books, music, software licenses, etc.
- Trade DAIPs: A marketplace enables users to list, buy, and sell DAIPs using cryptocurrency.
- DAO Governance: DAIP ownership can be governed by a DAO, allowing stakeholders to vote on changes to the intellectual property‚Äôs rules, usage rights, and revenue sharing.
- Smart Contracts: All DAIP-related transactions are secured by Ethereum smart contracts.

## üîß Planned Enhancements
- Integration with DeFi platforms: Earn royalties or lending income from DAIPs through decentralized finance protocols.
- Cross-marketplace Compatibility: Trade DAIPs on external NFT marketplaces such as OpenSea.
- AI-driven Auditing: Automatic auditing of DAIPs for compliance and governance using machine learning algorithms.
- Fee Optimization: Implement a gas-optimized protocol for lower transaction costs.

## Tech Stack
## _Backend (Smart Contracts)_
- Solidity: Language for writing Ethereum smart contracts.
- Foundry: A blazing fast, portable, and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development.
- OpenZeppelin Contracts: Standard libraries for security in Solidity.

## _Frontend (dApp)_
- Next.js: React-based framework for building web apps.
- Ethers.js: A JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum.
- Tailwind CSS: Utility-first CSS framework for building responsive designs.

## _Blockchain_
- Ethereum: The primary blockchain network (testnets like Goerli or Mumbai for development).
- MetaMask: Ethereum wallet used for blockchain interactions in the browser.

## Architecture
- DAIP Token (NFT): A custom ERC-721 smart contract representing intellectual properties.
- DAO Governance: A voting mechanism using governance tokens (ERC20-based) that enables stakeholders to manage DAIP rights and policies.
- Marketplace: A decentralized marketplace where users can list and buy DAIPs.
- Frontend: A Next.js-powered web app with Ethers.js for interacting with the blockchain.

## Getting Started
## _Prerequisites_
### Ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js
- MetaMask
- Foundry (for smart contract development)
- An Ethereum testnet (Goerli, Mumbai) account with test ETH

## Installation

- Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thesandf/DAIPs
cd DAIPs
```

- Install dependencies for the frontend:

```sh
npm install
```

- Set up environment variables: Create a .env.local file in the root of the project and include the following:

```sh
NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=<your-infura-project-id>
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<deployed-daip-contract-address>
```

- Deploy contracts to an Ethereum testnet:

```sh
forge create --rpc-url <RPC_URL> --private-key <PRIVATE_KEY> src/DAIP.sol
```

- Run the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```
- Open the app at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

## Smart Contracts
- DAIP.sol: The ERC-721 contract for creating and managing DAIPs.
- DAIPMarketplace.sol: The marketplace for listing and trading DAIPs.
- DAIPGovernance.sol: The DAO governance contract for voting and decision-making.
